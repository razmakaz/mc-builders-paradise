To update, 
- Close Curseforge or Run the executable as an Administrator

The package is self-signed and Microsoft doesn't like that, so it'll complain. 

If it says it doesn't want to run the executable, click "More Info", the click "Run Anyway".

It should pop up a window showing you what's happening as it updates. 

When it's done, it'll tell that it's successfully updated. You can close the window.

If you run into any problems, contact Razmakaz.
